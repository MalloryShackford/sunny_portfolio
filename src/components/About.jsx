In web development, I learned how to translate business goals into effective digital solutions. As a teacher, I developed strong communication and leadership skills, ensuring clarity and engagement. This diverse background allows me to bridge the gap between customers, technology, and product strategyâ€”making me a strong fit for a Customer Success or Product Manager role.</p>
